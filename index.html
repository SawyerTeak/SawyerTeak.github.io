  <h2>Accademics</h2>
      <p>I am a freshman at Gonzaga studying biomedical engineering. I chose this major because I want to give people, particularly young children and athletes arms and legs so they can experience the same joy that I feel while exercising</p>
  <h2>Athletics</h2>
      <p>I had never done a sport before high school so I decided two weeks into my freshman year to try cross country and somehow here I am now running for Gonzaga a the Division one level.</p>

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Carving wooden spoons</strong> and other similar things is something you probably wouldn't' guess I love to do at a glance but in fact it is. I would say I have carved close to 100 spoons so far starting from around eight years old until now. Even though its something I love I don't do it as often as I would like especially since I got to GU</li>
          <li>I cant really remember how it happened but two summers ago my friends and I essentially became heavily addicted to <strong>disc golf</strong>. This is something I definitely love doing especially because it means playing in the forest with friends</li>
          <li>I am very fortunate to have grown up with parents who are great cooks and love <strong>food</strong>. This is something that has been passed on to me as well and some of my favorite things to make are stir fry, pesto pasta, salmon, and any kind of pie</li>
          <li>Another one of my hobbies that I actually love doing while carving, playing disc golf and cooking is <strong>listening to audio books</strong>. My favorite author is most definitely Branden Sanderson and I've listened to pretty much all of his books which if I had to guess is around 1000 hours of listening..</li>
      </ul>
  <h2>Fun Facts</h2>

      <li>I built a tiny house starting in 8th grade which I still live in.</li>
